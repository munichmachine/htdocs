I'm a 58 years old man with a small writer stuffed away somewhere. I've started writing a book about the big city fire of Aalesund
in 1904.

My book will be built upon technical facts and a dramatized fictional story based on reports and police journals.

I'm going to write a complete storyboard to accompany the book. The storyboard will be written in English, and the book 
will follow soon after the Norwegian publication date.

The publishing date will be in somewhere of 2019-2021

The research and character building will be the biggest task ahead. They will be built on real people living in and 
around the city, and to get a reality that's spot on, will take the better part of the time spent.

I will post the development and general information about my findings. My website is https://www.knivedalen.net.
